Steps for cleaning perseus data

```
Should add Book publisher, title, editor, publisher place info from tei header (new table related to work)

TEI had an api to convert from a tei format to something more machine-friendly. Not sure if this is useful, but worth a shot esp. if there isn't a handy library to work with xml (pandas? or pandas-like)
```

1. Partition authors by language:
    -Latin
    -Greek
    -Other/Unknown

2. Partition author by work (create JSON for each work)
    -A file equates to a work
    -pull out all work-level attributes here, including book info
    
<now working with json>
    
3. Marry English text to Non-English

4. Partition work by subsection
    - Ensure English subsection stays with Non-English
