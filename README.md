VILLA is a comprehensive, open-source, online archive of Latin Literature. By developing this resource, we hope to democratize the study of Classics for a new generation. Classics is an ideal subject for academic study in a variety of ways, not least of which is that all the original works, and much of the keystone scholarship, is in the public domain and has been for centuries. The study of Classics has always had a high barrier to entry due to the relative inaccessibility of the texts, but now we aim to make them easily available for study by both the seasoned professional and the cautious novice.

This repository will hold the data, specifically raw data from Perseus, in addition to scripts used to clean it and information about the database that is built with it. The backend and frontend will have their own repositories once the VILLA database v1.0.0 is released.
